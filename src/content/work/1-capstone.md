## Project Overview

For my NAIT capstone project, I worked with two classmates on the redesign and development of a 9-page website for Print|ED, a local printing company in Edmonton. The problem with the website was that it was not functional, and more of a "glorified business card" with not much content and pages that show the products and services the site offers. 

### The Process

During the first meeting, the client wanted some featured products and services to be featured prominently on the website. One of the client's goals was good SEO for the featured products, where the user would search for the product, and it would link to his website. Another deliverable was a redesign of the client's current logo. My role in the group was to help with both the design and development of the website. Using Figma, I adjusted the design elements using CRAP principles, created the layout design for the products, and was also responsible for redesigning the logo. Using Astro as our framework, I created the navigation and footer components to be reused throughout the site.

### Challenge and Solution

One of the goals as a team for this project was to learn new technologies, so we decided to learn and use Strapi as the content management system and Astro as the front-end JavaScript framework. We faced a challenge with Strapi because it needed a separate server to host all the web content itself. We did a lot of testing and research on different cloud hosting providers and decided on Strapi's own service, because of the free tier for development and flexibility for the client to upgrade to a paid tier.

### Results and Learning

I learned that I am capable of delivering and handling real-world projects for clients, learning new technologies, and working collaboratively with team members on projects.
