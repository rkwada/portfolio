## Project Overview

A personal project combining my two passions, music and web development. I wanted to create a drum machine sequencer that you can play in the browser. <a href="https://drum-machine-sequencer-drab.vercel.app/">View the website here.</a>

### The Process

Inspired by <a href="https://io808.com/">io808.com</a>, I researched and used Tone.js, a framework that uses the Web Audio API to create a mini-synthesizer (you can check that out <a href="/synth/">here!</a>). I used the tools that I learned with the Tone.js project with JavaScript to create a looping 1-bar drum beat by pressing the buttons to activate the drum sounds. Some of the features I made were to be able to change the BPM and to follow the notes using an indicator above the buttons.

### Upcoming Features 

Some things I am currently developing are styling, adding effects, and the ability to switch to different drum kits.

### Challenges

A challenge I faced when I created the original concept was just learning how to use my own audio in the project. I tried using the Sampler function in Tone.js to play my samples, but I learned that there is a Player function to use the audio in the project folder to play the sound which was an easier way to play the audio in this case. 

### Results

The result right now is a functioning drum machine sequencer that plays a drum beat with the ability to change audio levels for each drum sound. I am working on implementing some features, but let me know if you have ideas!
